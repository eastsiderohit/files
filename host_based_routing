First install nginx
Then ask dev the services name and on which ip address it is running and port num 
Then navigate to route53 
Then create one subdomain of your root domain (as of now my root domain is shidoscan.com)
Then as of now i gave in under record name “game”
Then select A type why because you want to route traffic on an ipv4 address
Then under value give the ip on which your service is running 
Then select simple routing 
Then select create records
Once record is created navigare to ec2 server via ssh 
Then navigate to directory /etc/nginx/conf.d
Then create a file with name “host_based_routing.conf”
Then paste this below content on that file 
# Server block for game.shidoscan.com
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name game.shidoscan.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://54.216.151.111:3001;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
Then save the file 
Then execute command sudo nginx -t
Then execute command sudo systemctl reload nginx
