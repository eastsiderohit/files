Cross zone load balancing: It means load distributes evenly / equally to all the nodes in each availability zone

Without cross zone load balancing: It means load distributed unevenly on each availability zone 	

WebSocket: It means it wil, continue fetch data with requesting for example: block number
 
api: application interface it means communication between 2 application 

Network load balancer: It support protocol like

 TCP (Transmission control protocol) : reliable, connection oriented

 TLS (Transport layer security) : secures TCP traffic by encrypting data

 UDP (User datagram protocol) : Connectionless, lightweight protocol for low-latency    transmission

Application load balancer: It support protocol like

 HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): data communication for the web, enabling browsing and other HTTP-based interactions

 HTTPS (HTTP Secure): providing encrypted communication and secure identification of a network web server

 gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Call): A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework that can use HTTP/2 for transport

 WebSocket: A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, commonly used for real-time applications
 
 Placement group: Types

Partition placement group 
Spread placement group
Cluster placement group

Partition placement group: In single availability zone for example us-east-1a you are creating any num of partition like 2 or 3 and you are deploying server in it (instances does not share the same hardware and in diff partition) 

Spread placement group: In each availability zone you are creating server like us-east-1 us-east-1b us-east-1c (

Cluster placement group: Share all (low latency, high network throughput)


SSL/TLS: TLS is a upgrade version of ssl and ssl you can buy from godaddy, letsencrypt etcâ€¦and ssl use to encrypt communication between client and load balancer, with AWS ACM service you can buy the certificate

If you want to implement ssl on load balancer then 
click on load balancer 
Then clik on add listener
Then clck on protocol select https and port 443
In certificate section you can select IAM, ACM, or import


ASG (AutoScaling Group) template:

AMI, Instance type, EBS Volume, Security groups, ssh keypair, IAM Roles, Network & Subnet information

ELB (elastic load balancer) provide static dns name 

NLB (network load balancer) provide both static ip and dns name 

Scaling an EC2 instance from r4.large to r4.4xlarge is called Vertical scalability

Running an application on an Auto Scaling Group that scales the number of EC2 instances in and out is called Horizontal Scalability
