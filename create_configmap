First ask dev to share env’s which will look like this below (as of now i have saitachain env’s testnet)

SOCKET SERVICE


PORT=7600
NODE_ENV=local
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
PROJECT_NAME=Saitachain

SOCKET_HOST=wss://wss-stage-nodes.saitascan.io

RabbitMqURL=amqp://admin:lwAqCIdLHCNY486CpOPc@10.1.153.159
BACKEND_API_HOST=http://localhost:7800/api/saita/explorer

Then give the name according to service (as of now my service name is explorer-native-ws)
Then make sure you have configured aws 
Then create file in your local system with .yaml extension
Then execute the file with command below 
Kubectl create configmap explorer-native-ws –from-env-file=explorer-native-ws.yaml (it will create configmap)
Then navigate to lens dashboard
Then click on configmap 
Then select your configmap and click on edit you will see your env’s 
Then run your deployment file service file and hpa.yaml file
Then ask dev to share the latest env and navigate again to configmap and update the latest env 
Then ask dev the repo name 
Then see which access do you have (maintainer access needed)
Then clone the repo in your local system or in your ec2 instance (use your gitlab token)
Then switch the branch where you have the code 
Then navigate to ecr 
Then click on ecr repo
Then click on view push command 
Execute all the docker commands
Then navigate to lens dashboard
Then click on deployments 
Restart your deployment according to your service 
Once it comes in running state 
Then on the lens dashboard left pane
Click on network
Then click on services 
Then click on your desired services 
Then click on ports forward port 
Then check your deployment file if it is like this below example 
httpGet:
             path: /saita/status
             port: 7900

Then copy /saita/status and paste it
