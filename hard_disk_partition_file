Make a file with name mount.sh and paste the entire file 
Execute command 
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf	
lsblk
df -Th
lsblk 
sudo mount -a and for unmount “sudo umount /dev/xvdf <your directory xyz>”
sudo xfs_growfs /dev/xvdf


#!/bin/bash
sudo mkdir /data #create directory
disk2=$(lsblk -nx size -o kname|tail  -1 |awk {'printf "/dev/"$1'}) # To find unmount partition
sudo mkfs -t xfs $disk2 # To make a filesystem on partition 
sleep 30
sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab-old # To backup file /etc/fstab-old
VUUID=$(sudo blkid -o value -s UUID $disk2)
sleep 30
sudo su -c "echo 'UUID=$VUUID  /data   xfs   defaults        0       0' >> /etc/fstab" # To entry permanent mount

sudo mount -a
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /data # change the ownership /data dir.



Another way of data partition:
 
Manually attach  desired storage volumes to ec2 instance 
Then navigate to cloud 
Execute command lsblk it will show your attached volume like this xvdf   2 G  disk
Then make one directory with name /data
Then execute command sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf it will generate UUID=
Copy that UUID number 
Open file sudo nano /etc/fstab
Paste there UUID=45bcf375-a40f-481b-9e0e-525d2e92f87e  /data   ext4   defaults        0
Then exit from the file 
Execute command sudo mount -a it will mount your additional volume in /data
Then again execute lsblk and df -Th you will see your volume mounted on /data and total avail size 







Similarly if you want to unmount and attach to other directory or want to increase you can do these following steps:

First manually increase the volume 

Come back to terminal
Then execute command lsblk it will show how much you have increased as of now am having 2gb and am increasing it to 3gb 
Execute command lsblk
Then make one directory where you want to mount as of now am making /data2
Then open /etc/fstab file just replace the directory with the name which you have created as of now i have created /data2
Then execute command sudo umount /dev/xvdf /data to unmount from /data directory
Then execute command sudo mount -a it will get mount to the new directory /data2

screen -S <name> ----------> create screen command as of now my screen name is download 
screen -r download 
 screen -ls (to see whether my screen is created or not)
 ctrl+a+d to come out from screen detached mode
