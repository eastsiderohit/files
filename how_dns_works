  Authoritative Server                  TLD                                                                                                                 


User                           : It can be anyone either me and you

DNS resolver            : It sits between user and dns server, and it works as an intermediary and        it resolves domain name into ip address which is binded with domain.

DNS/Root server      : It route request to top level domain (TLD) 

TLD                            : Top level domain for e.g., .org, .net, .com, .gov, .edu

Authoritative server : It stores ip and domain both 






Types of record:

A                 : It maps domain name to ip address (for e.g., example.com -> 192.0.2.1)

AAAA         : It maps domain name to ipv6 address (for e.g., example.com -> 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

CNAME      : It maps subdomain to root domain (for e.g., www.example.com -> example.com)

MX Record : It attach with mail servers responsible for receiving email on behalf of a domain (for e.g., example.com -> mail.example.com (priority 10))

TXT Record : Stores text information related to domain (for e.g., example.com -> "v=spf1 include:_spf.example.com ~all")
